# User Authentication : AWS Cognito | JavaScript
- AWS Cognito User pools
- Google Federated Login
- Facebook Federated Login

__Requirements__

Get one here [Create an AWS Account for Free](https://aws.amazon.com). Choose **Create an AWS Account**


__Structure__
- Processed files are found in the ```application/dist``` directory. 

__NPM Scripts__
```javascript 
//runs the prebuild and build steps.
//uses postcss and cssnext to compile the core.css file
//then runs webpack and webpack creats the JS bundle and moves the index.html file over to the dist folder.
npm run build 
```
